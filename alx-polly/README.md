# ALX_AI_For_Developers_2

Welcome to ALX AI For Developers 2 ðŸš€

This repository contains a collection of AI-assisted coding projects and vibe-coded experiments created during the ALX AI for Developers program.
Rather than focusing on traditional ML/DL models, these projects highlight the use of AI coding tools (like Cursor, Copilot, and ChatGPT) to speed up development, explore creative ideas, and build practical applications.
